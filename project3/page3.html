              In January 2011, a trio of researchers published the results of an experiment in which they demonstrated that students who read material in difficult, unfamiliar fonts learned it more deeply than students who read the same material in conventional, familiar fonts.

            As the researchers pointed out in their article in the journal Cognition, both students and teachers may sometimes judge the success of a learning experience by the ease with which the learner processes or "encodes" the new information. But learning material easily, or fluently, may sometimes produce shallower levels of learning.

            To test that principle, the researchers compared the learning results of two groups of subjects in a lab at Princeton University. Both groups were asked to memorize information about three (fictional) species of aliens that was presented to them in a way designed to mimic the biologic taxonomies they would learn in a typical introductory science course. One group read material in a common black font (Arial), and one read it in more unusual and difficult gray-scale fonts (Comic Sans MS and Bodoni MT).

            The subjects had 90 minutes to memorize as much of the material as they could. Following a 15-minute delay, they were tested on their recall. The group that had read the alien taxonomies in unusual fonts scored, on average, 14 percentage points higher than the group that had processed the material in the more familiar font.

            To find out if their results were more than a laboratory anomaly, the researchers produced a second experiment with the cooperation of a high school in Ohio.

            They asked teachers in six courses to send in their supplementary materials for a unit, such as worksheets and PowerPoint slides. In each case, the instructor was teaching two sections of the same course. One set of materials, for the control group, was returned unedited to the teachers; the other set was manipulated into the more difficult fonts. After the unit was completed in each course—time periods that ranged from a week to a month—the researchers looked at how students had performed on tests of the material.

            I asked the group to identify strategies that would be grounded in specific courses they taught, but generalizable to a wider variety of disciplines. After proposing many approaches, we noticed that we could group them together into a small handful of techniques, the top four of which are as follows:

              <h4>Ask students to process or translate course material using unusual rhetorical or expressive modes.</h4>
             I have always listened with skepticism to accounts of teachers asking their students to translate course concepts into 140-character status updates. But my workshop participants argued that having students take concepts and rework them in the form of a text message, or a Twitter update, or even visual representations or performances, could have the same defamiliarizing effect that might be achieved by a change in fonts.

            <h4>Require students to argue on behalf of unfamiliar positions.</h4>
             One of my participants was a political scientist who asks her students to debate issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict—and routinely requires them to argue against their personally held convictions. Another participant, who teaches a course for medical students on abortion, does the same. In both cases, they observed, students are forced into the uncomfortable and defamiliarizing position of having to look at a well-trod debate from a new angle.

            <h4>Ask students to find or identify mistakes.</h4>
              A professor of architecture noted that he occasionally makes mistakes while doing calculations on the board, and that his students had learned to watch out for those errors and correct him. A math professor then pointed out that he would sometimes deliberately seed mistakes into assigned problems and ask students to find them. In both cases students were nudged out of the mode of simply observing or running through the problems on automatic pilot. That may seem like an artificial technique, or like playing games with students—but only until you stop and think about how many jobs require people to review presentations, problems, performances, or communications and make sure they are mistake-free.

            <h4>Plan for failure.</h4>
               A faculty member in chemistry said you can wake students up by asking them to undertake short experiments that are designed to fail. Rather than simply going through the motions of a lab, and finding the expected result planned for them by the teacher, students learn what every experienced researcher in the world knows: that experiments, like scholarly research of any kind, almost never proceed exactly as you planned them, and that you can learn a lot from your failures.
