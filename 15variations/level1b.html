			I have always said that there are three aspects <br>in Design that are important to me: <br>
_____________________________________<br>
<br>
Semantic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syntactic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic
<br>
_____________________________________<br>
<br>
Let’s examine them one at the time.<br>
Semantics, for me, is the search of <br>the meaning of whatever we have to design. <br>

The very first thing that I do whenever <br>I start a new assignment in any form of<br>
design, graphic, product, exhibition or <br>interior is to search for the meaning of it.<br>

That may start with research on the history of <br>the subject to better understand the nature of<br>
the project and to find the most appropriate <br>direction for the development of a new design.<br>
