    <h1>Bruce Mau | An incomplete manifesto for growth (cont.)</h1>

    <div class="list">

     Stand on someone’s shoulders. You can travel farther carried on the accomplishments of those who came before you. And the view is so much better.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 24 </div> <br>
    Avoid software. The problem with software is that everyone has it.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 25 </div> <br>
    Don’t clean your desk. You might find something in the morning that you can’t see tonight.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 26 </div> <br>
    Don’t enter awards competitions. Just don’t. It’s not good for you.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 27 </div> <br>
    Read only left–hand pages. Marshall McLuhan did this. By decreasing the amount of information, we leave room for what he called our ‘noodle’.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 28 </div> <br>
    Make new words. Expand the lexicon. The new conditions demand a new way of thinking. The thinking demands new forms of expression. The expression generates new conditions.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 29 </div> <br>
    Think with your mind. Forget technology. Creativity is not device–dependent.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 30 </div> <br>
    Organization = Liberty. Real innovation in design, or any other field, happens in context. That context is usually some form of cooperatively managed enterprise. Frank Gehry, for instance, is only able to realize Bilbao because his studio can deliver it on budget. The myth of a split between ‘creatives’ and ‘suits’ is what Leonard Cohen calls a “charming artifact of the past.”</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 31 </div> <br>
    Don’t borrow money. Once again, Frank Gehry’s advice. By maintaining financial control, we maintain creative control. It’s not exactly rocket science, but it’s surprising how hard it is to maintain this discipline, and how many have failed.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 32 </div> <br>
    Listen carefully. Every collaborator who enters our orbit brings with him or her a world more strange and complex than any we could ever hope to imagine. By listening to the details and the subtlety of their needs, desires, or ambitions, we fold their world onto our own. Neither party will ever be the same.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 33 </div> <br>
    Take field trips. The bandwidth of the world is greater than that of your TV set, or the Internet, or even a totally immersive, interactive, dynamically rendered, object–oriented, real–time, computer graphic–simulated environment.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 34 </div> <br>
    Make mistakes faster. This isn’t my idea—I borrowed it. I think it belongs to Andy Grove.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 35 </div> <br>
    Imitate. Don’t be shy about it. Try to get as close as you can. You’ll never get all the way, and the separation might be truly remarkable. We have only to look to Richard Hamilton and his version of Marcel Duchamp’s large glass to see how rich, discredited, and underused imitation is as a technique.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 36 </div> <br>
    Scat. When you forget the words, do what Ella did: make up something else… but not words.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 37 </div> <br>
    Break it, stretch it, bend it, crush it, crack it, fold it.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 38 </div> <br>
    Explore the other edge. Great liberty exists when we avoid trying to run with the technological pack. We can’t find the leading edge because it’s trampled underfoot. Try using old–tech equipment made obsolete by an economic cycle but still rich with potential.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 39 </div> <br>
    Coffee breaks, cab rides, green rooms. Real growth often happens outside of where we intend it to, in the interstitial spaces—what Dr. Seuss calls “the waiting place.” Hans Ulrich Obrist once organized a science and art conference with all of the infrastructure of a conference—the parties, chats, lunches, airport arrivals—but with no actual conference. Apparently it was hugely successful and spawned many ongoing collaborations.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 40 </div> <br>
    Avoid fields. Jump fences. Disciplinary boundaries and regulatory regimes are attempts to control the wilding of creative life. They are often understandable efforts to order what are manifold, complex, evolutionary processes. Our job is to jump the fences and cross the fields.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 41 </div> <br>
    Laugh. People visiting the studio often comment on how much we laugh. Since I’ve become aware of this, I use it as a barometer of how comfortably we are expressing ourselves.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 42 </div> <br>
     Remember. Growth is only possible as a product of history. Without memory, innovation is merely novelty. History gives growth a direction. But a memory is never perfect. Every memory is a degraded or composite image of a previous moment or event. That’s what makes us aware of its quality as a past and not a present. It means that every memory is new, a partial construct different from its source, and, as such, a potential for growth itself.</div>

    <div class="list">
    <div class="number"> 43 </div> <br>
    Power to the people. Play can only happen when people feel they have control over their lives. We can’t be free agents if we’re not free.  </div>
