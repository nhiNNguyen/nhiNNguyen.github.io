    <h1> DOES BEAUTIFUL DESIGN LAYOUT HELP WITH <span class="special">reading </span> AND <span class="special">remembering </span>YOUR INFORMATION BETTER?</h1>

      <h4> TEXTS </h4>
      <p>  "The aesthetic of Jony Ive's iOS7, with its flat icons and defiant lack of adornment; it's an aesthetic for a world that does its reading on smooth pieces of black glass with curved corners. It's the aesthetic that's rapidly coming to dominate the web – which is why I feel some nervousness in poking my head above the parapet to say: what if I don't want my reading experience to be this beautiful?"<span class="number">[1]</span></p>

      <p> "The challenge that we face, then, is to create what psychologists call "desirable difficulties": enough cognitive disfluency to promote deeper learning, and not so much that we reduce the motivation of our students.""<span class="number2">[2]</span></p>

      <p> "There's some evidence to suggest that when you make the reading experience too smooth and glossy and beautiful, you make it less engaging and satisfying, too. The key concept here, explored in depth by the psychologist Adam Alter, author of the book Drunk Tank Pink, is "cognitive disfluency". When information glides by too frictionlessly, we're liable to find it harder both to understand and to retain.""<span class="number3">[3]</span></p>

      <p> "It would be nice if they could remember that current aesthetic fashions are just current aesthetic fashions – not some ultimate Platonic ideal of how to communicate online.""<span class="number4">[4]</span></p>

      <h4> WHY </h4>
      <p>  'Minimalist' + 'White spaces' = 'Beautiful'. Does web design need to aim for 'beautiful'? The argument is not about dismissing minimalism but about questioning ‘Is using the ‘beautiful’ standard the ultimate goal when designing reading materials for web?' How does it help people process contents from a webpage since the sole purpose of a layout is to assist people in understanding its information? </p>

      <h4> QUESTIONS </h4>
      <p> 1. What is the best way to showcase contents in order for it to be found quicker?<br>
          2. Do people care much for design layout when reading online? <br>
          3. In design layout, do different criteria apply for different forms of reading materials such as novel,      blog, news, journal, etc.?
